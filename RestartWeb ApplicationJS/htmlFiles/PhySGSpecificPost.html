                        Midnights become my afternoons
                        When my depression works the graveyard shift
                        All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
                        I should not be left to my own devices
                        They come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
                        (Tale as old as time)
                        I wake up screaming from dreaming
                        One day I'll watch as you're leaving
                        'Cause you got tired of my scheming
                        (For the last time)
                        
                        It's me
                        Hi
                        I'm the problem, it's me
                        At teatime
                        Everybody agrees
                        I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
                        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
                        
                        Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
                        And I'm a monster on the hill
                        Too big to hang out
                        Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
                        Pierced through the heart but never killed
                        Did you hear my covert narcissism
                        I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman?
                        (Tale as old as time)

                        One day I'll watch as you're leaving and life will lose all its meaning
                        (For the last time)

                        I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
                        She thinks I left them in the will
                        The family gathers 'round and reads it
                        And then someone screams out
                        "She's laughing up at us from hell!"
                        
                        It's me
